Project MobileTariff

A database "mobile.db" is being created with two tables "mobile_users" and "mobile_tariff". 
The administrator enters the number of months for which the calculation is performed for each user. 
As soon as the user does not have enough funds, his Activity status changes to 'No', 
a notification is displayed in the terminal that the user does not have enough funds 
and will not be taken further in the billing period.
